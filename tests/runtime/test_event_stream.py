"""Tests for ``EventStream`` Protocol + ``InProcessEventStream`` impl.

The contract is intentionally loose (notifications may be lost /
duplicated / reordered) so consumers always read full events from the
``EventLogRepository`` after waking up. The in-process implementation
preserves order + delivery within a single process, which is the most
common dev / single-worker case.

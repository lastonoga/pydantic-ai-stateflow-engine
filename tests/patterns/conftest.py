"""DBOS bootstrap for pattern tests that need a running runtime.

``Reflection.run`` is a @DBOS.workflow and ``Reflection._write`` /
``_critique`` are @DBOS.step, so DBOS must be initialised before the
wrapped callables can be invoked. We use a session-scoped temporary
SQLite system database (DBOS supports sqlite natively) so the suite
runs without Docker, and only spin DBOS up for the tests that actually
need it (those that explicitly request ``dbos_runtime``).

Event-loop / executor note: pytest-asyncio (mode=auto) creates a fresh
event loop per async test, and each loop's default executor is shut
down on loop close. DBOS caches its own ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` in
``dbos._executor_field`` and installs it as the running loop's default
via ``_configure_asyncio_thread_pool()``. After the first test's loop
closes, DBOS's cached executor is broken; the next test reinstalls the
broken executor and dies with ``cannot schedule new futures after
shutdown``. Fix: replace ``dbos._executor_field`` with a fresh pool
before every async test that touches DBOS.

"""Observability — ObservabilityProvider with a soft logfire dependency.

logfire is an optional dependency. When absent, every observability shim
degrades to a no-op so the test suite (and applications that don't want
telemetry) keep working. Spec 4D, 4H.

# Auto-install the cost-fallback patch at framework import. The patch
# is purely additive — without any extractors registered it re-raises
# the original ``LookupError``, so behaviour is identical to
# unpatched pydantic-ai when nothing else opts in. Apps register
# extractors via ``ObservabilityProvider(cost_extractors=...)`` or
# ``register_cost_extractor(...)`` and the same patch handles them.

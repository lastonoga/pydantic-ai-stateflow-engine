"""Pluggable cost-extraction fallback for ``ModelResponse.cost()``.

## Problem

``pydantic-ai``'s ``InstrumentedModel`` populates the ``operation.cost``
span attribute by calling ``ModelResponse.cost()``, which delegates to
`genai-prices <https://github.com/pydantic/genai-prices>`_. That library
ships a static catalogue of ``(provider, model)`` pairs; anything not
listed (e.g. ``qwen/qwen3.6-plus`` on OpenRouter at the time of writing)
raises ``LookupError`` and pydantic-ai silently swallows it. Result: no
cost on any span for those agents, even when the upstream provider
returned the real billed cost in the response.

## Design

A ``CostExtractor`` is a strategy that knows how to pull a real billed
cost off a ``ModelResponse`` — typically from ``provider_details`` or a
provider-specific field. The framework ships a default extractor for
``provider_details['cost']`` (OpenRouter + several other adapters
already populate it there). Apps register additional extractors via
``register_cost_extractor(...)`` (typically called once at boot, before
``ObservabilityConfig().install()``).

``install_cost_fallback_patch()`` monkey-patches ``ModelResponse.cost``
once: on ``LookupError`` from the original ``cost()``, it walks the
registered extractors and returns a duck-typed result that satisfies
``InstrumentedModel`` (which only reads ``.total_price``). When
genai-prices later adds an entry for the model, the original lookup
succeeds first and the patch becomes a no-op.

## Why monkey-patch and not a wrapper Model class

``ModelResponse.cost`` is a method on a pydantic model that
``InstrumentedModel`` invokes directly via attribute lookup on the
response object. Subclassing ``ModelResponse`` would require every
adapter (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ...) to instantiate the
subclass — defeats the point. A targeted patch on the method handles
every adapter uniformly.

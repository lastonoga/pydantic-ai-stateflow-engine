"""Framework-level upstream compatibility shims.

Each shim documents the upstream issue it works around and the
conditions for its removal. Shims now follow a **pluggable** pattern:
the framework installs a single monkey-patch and exposes a registry
of strategy objects, so apps can extend the behaviour for new
upstream quirks without copying the patch.

Default strategies are registered at import-time so behaviour stays
unchanged for callers that just ``import ballast``.
Apps that want to override a default reach for the relevant
``configure_*`` helper exported from
``ballast.observability`` / this module.

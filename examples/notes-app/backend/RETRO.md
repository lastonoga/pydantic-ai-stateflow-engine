# Iteration 2 retrospective — backend + single agent + streaming

## What worked smoothly

- **`Engine.fastapi_app(extra_routers=[...])` is the right shape.** Wiring a
  real app took ~10 lines: build a repo, build a runner, hand both routers
  to the factory. Lifespan / `app.state.container` / `/healthz` come for
  free.
- **`InMemoryThreadRepository` is a complete drop-in.** No subclassing, no
  override gymnastics — the `ThreadRepository` Protocol means I can later
  swap to Postgres without touching the routers.
- **The `StreamEvent` + `StreamEncoder` split is clean.** `agent_runner`
  speaks the protocol-neutral `StreamEvent`, the framework's `AGUIEncoder`
  turns it into SSE frames. Iteration 3's frontend can pick `ag-ui` or
  `vercel` via `?protocol=` with zero changes here.
- **`Engine(providers=[])` is legal.** Iteration 2 wants no DBOS / no
  Postgres, and the framework didn't fight that — empty provider list +
  `fastapi_app()` boots cleanly.
- **`get_tenant_id` already does the `X-Tenant-Id`-header thing.** No need
  to write tenant middleware just to satisfy the threads router.

## Friction points (framework ergonomics gaps)

1. **No built-in pydantic-ai → `StreamEvent` adapter.** Every consumer of
   `build_streaming_router` is forced to hand-roll the same translation:
   call `agent.run_stream(...)`, iterate `stream_output(...)` (or
   `stream_text(...)`), diff against the last emitted prefix to compute a
   true text delta, emit `text_delta` + `done` + `error`. This is the
   single biggest copy-paste hazard. A shipping
   `ballast.adapters.pydantic_ai.make_runner(agent, *,
   text_field="reply")` would erase ~80 lines of boilerplate per app.
2. **`_PostMessageBody.parts: list[dict]` has no documented schema.** The
   router validates "it's a list of dicts" and stops. Every agent_runner
   re-invents `_extract_user_text(parts)`. Either ship a typed `MessagePart`
   union (text / tool_result / file_ref) or at least a helper
   `framework.api.streaming.extract_text(parts) -> str`.
3. **`AgentRunner` signature is `Callable[..., AsyncIterator[StreamEvent]]`
   with three named kwargs (`thread_id`, `message`, `tenant_id`) only
   discoverable by reading `router.py`.** Should be a Protocol class with
   precise types — mypy currently can't catch a misnamed kwarg in the
   runner.
4. **The router persists the user message but never the assistant reply.**
   After `done`, nothing writes the assistant turn back into the repo, so
   `GET /threads/{id}/messages` will not contain the LLM output. Either the
   runner is contractually responsible for `repo.add_message(role="assistant",
   ...)` after `done` (undocumented), or the router should do it
   automatically from the `done` event payload.
5. **`AGUIEncoder` event names (`text_delta`, `done`) are an undocumented
   contract with the frontend.** There is no `StreamEventKind` enum or
   docstring saying which kinds the AG-UI encoder will pass through, what
   assistant-ui expects, or how to extend. Iteration 3 will discover this
   the hard way.
6. **Engine boot prints nothing.** A booted-with-no-providers app would be
   indistinguishable from a misconfigured one in production logs. A single
   structured log line on boot (`providers=[], invariants=[]`) would help.
7. **`Engine.fastapi_app()` has no `cors=` or `lifespan_hooks=` knob.** Any
   real frontend will need CORS configured before the first browser call.
   Right now I'd have to drop down to mutating the returned `FastAPI`.

## OpenRouter + pydantic-ai notes

The integration is **two-line trivial** in pydantic-ai 1.97.0:

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider

provider = OpenAIProvider(
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
    api_key=os.environ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"],
)
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIModel("qwen/qwen3.6-plus", provider=provider),
    output_type=ChatReply,           # pydantic BaseModel
    system_prompt="You are ...",
)
```

- **Structured output for `output_type=ChatReply` is routed through
  function/tool-calling** on the OpenAI-compatible backend (not
  `response_format: json_schema`). pydantic-ai registers a synthetic
  `final_result` tool whose schema matches `ChatReply`. Qwen models on
  OpenRouter advertise tool-calling, so this works out of the box — no
  `response_format` shim, no JSON-mode fallback needed.
- **Streaming under `output_type=BaseModel` uses partial pydantic validation.**
  `result.stream_output(debounce_by=0.05)` yields progressively-validated
  `ChatReply` instances as JSON tokens arrive. The `reply` field grows
  monotonically in the common case, but pydantic's partial mode is allowed
  to revise (e.g. when a `"` closes a token-truncated string) — our adapter
  defensively handles that by falling back to a full re-emit if the new
  value isn't a prefix-extension.
- **`stream_text(delta=True)` would be simpler but is `str`-output-only.**
  Pinned to `output_type=ChatReply`, we have to use `stream_output` + diff.

## Stream-event contract emitted by `agent_runner`

| kind         | data shape                              | when                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `text_delta` | `{"text": "<incremental chunk>"}`       | each partial token group   |
| `done`       | `{"reply": "<final full reply string>"}`| once, on clean completion  |
| `error`      | `{"message": "<stringified exception>"}`| once, on any failure       |

Iteration 3 must verify the assistant-ui frontend's AG-UI subscriber
recognises `text_delta` (it's the AG-UI canonical name) and treats `done`
as a stream terminator. If assistant-ui expects e.g. `text_message_start` /
`text_message_content` / `text_message_end` we'll surface that mismatch
here and either patch the frontend mapping or extend `AGUIEncoder`.

## Framework gaps for iteration 3

- [x] ~~`ballast.adapters.pydantic_ai.make_runner(agent, ...)`
      that owns the run-stream + diff + emit loop.~~ Landed as
      `ballast.api.streaming.make_runner` in iteration 2.1.
- [x] ~~Typed `MessagePart` union for `_PostMessageBody.parts`, plus
      `extract_text(parts)` helper.~~ Landed in iteration 2.1.
- [x] ~~`AgentRunner` as a typed `Protocol` (not `Callable[..., ...]`).~~
      Landed as a `@runtime_checkable` Protocol in iteration 2.1; carries
      `run_id` alongside `thread_id` / `message` / `tenant_id`.
- [ ] Auto-persist the assistant reply on `done`, or document the
      runner's contractual responsibility to call `repo.add_message`.
      (Tracked as Group C / F7.)
- [x] ~~`StreamEventKind` constants / enum + table of which kinds each
      encoder (`AGUIEncoder`, `VercelEncoder`) emits, with
      assistant-ui compatibility notes.~~ Landed as part of Group A
      (canonical AG-UI events), expanded by `make_runner` in 2.1.
- [ ] `Engine.fastapi_app(cors=..., lifespan_hooks=...)`. (Tracked as
      Group D / F8.)
- [ ] One structured `INFO` log line on `Engine.boot()`. (Tracked as
      Group D.)

## Iteration 2.2 update — framework Groups A–D landed (fix round complete)

All four groups of the dogfood-driven framework fix round are now in:

| Group | Commit | Scope |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| A | `3c71504` | Canonical AG-UI events + `StreamEventKind` enum |
| B | `01875fd` + `0219412` | `make_runner` adapter, typed `MessagePart`, `AgentRunner` Protocol |
| C | `00e8040` + `c735e71` | `Thread.title`/`ARCHIVED`, full thread CRUD, auto-persist assistant reply |
| D | (this commit pair) | `CORSConfig` + lifespan hooks on `Engine.fastapi_app`, verified client-disconnect propagation |

Gap items, final state:

- ~~F1 — pydantic-ai → `StreamEvent` adapter.~~ Landed (B).
- ~~F2 — typed `MessagePart` union + `extract_text`.~~ Landed (B).
- ~~F3 — `AgentRunner` Protocol.~~ Landed (B).
- ~~F4 — assistant reply auto-persistence on `text_message_end`.~~ Landed (C).
- ~~F5 — `StreamEventKind` enum + encoder coverage table.~~ Landed (A).
- ~~F6 — boot log line.~~ Landed (C/D auxiliary).
- ~~F7 — full thread CRUD (list / PATCH / archive / delete).~~ Landed (C).
- ~~F8 — `cors=` + lifespan hooks on `Engine.fastapi_app()`.~~ Landed (D).
- ~~F9 — typed `MessagePart` union exported.~~ Landed (B).
- ~~F10 — verified client-disconnect propagation on streaming endpoint.~~ Landed (D).
- ~~F11 — assistant reply persistence contract documented.~~ Landed (C).

### F10 abort-propagation finding (recorded for posterity)

Initial hope: a Starlette `StreamingResponse` will receive
`CancelledError` into its async generator on the next `yield` when the
client disconnects, and that cancellation will naturally tear down the
underlying agent runner + httpx request. **This is not reliably the case
under `httpx.ASGITransport` (and is server-implementation-dependent in
production too).** We therefore added an explicit
`request.is_disconnected()` poll loop in `_gen()` that runs concurrently
with the agent runner; when the client goes away we cancel the producer
task, which exits `agent.run_stream(...)` and aborts the upstream LLM
request via pydantic-ai's httpx client. The defensive
`try/except CancelledError` block remains as a belt-and-braces guard for
servers that *do* propagate cancellation.

## Iteration 3 — backend (notes domain + agent tools)

### What worked smoothly

- **`@agent.tool` on a method-style coroutine is a one-line ergonomic.**
  The five CRUD tools were ~12 lines each, and the docstring-as-LLM-prompt
  contract is exactly the right shape for "model uses tool" wiring.
- **`Agent[NoteToolDeps, ChatReply]` with `deps_type=NoteToolDeps` is the
  right boundary.** Per-request deps via `agent.run_stream(prompt, deps=...)`
  let us inject `(repo, tenant_id)` cleanly without globals.
- **Splitting `Note` (immutable BaseModel) from `NoteRow` (SQLModel)** keeps
  the agent-visible payload small and the future Postgres path open.
  Iteration 4+ can grow the row schema (audit cols, indexes) without
  leaking into the LLM's tool catalog.
- **Tools returning the saved `Note`** (not just `"ok"`) gives the model
  the `id` to chain follow-ups in the same turn. Worth the 4 extra bytes
  on the wire.
- **Tenant scoping inside the repo** (rather than at the tool layer) means
  cross-tenant bugs are impossible at the call site. `update` raises
  `KeyError` on wrong-tenant; `delete` is idempotent silent no-op (matches
  HTTP DELETE semantics — and keeps the model from learning about other
  tenants' notes via error messages).

### Friction points (framework ergonomics gaps surfaced this round)

1. **`make_runner(agent, deps=...)` only accepts a static `deps` value.**
   Every multi-tenant app will need per-request deps (`tenant_id` from
   `X-Tenant-Id`, repo from app state). Right now we have to hand-roll the
   `run_stream → stream_output → diff → emit` loop in `build_notes_runner`
   to inject fresh `NoteToolDeps` per call, duplicating ~30 lines of the
   framework adapter.

   **Proposed framework fix (F12):** `make_runner(agent, *, text_field,
   deps: Any | Callable[..., Any] | Callable[..., Awaitable[Any]] = None)`
   where if `deps` is callable it's invoked with the runner's kwargs
   (`thread_id, run_id, message, tenant_id`) per stream. Backwards-compat:
   non-callable `deps` keeps current behavior.

2. **Tool-call events aren't (yet) surfaced as canonical `StreamEvent`
   kinds.** The frontend can see the assistant's text reply, but it has no
   way to render "the model is calling `create_note(...)`" mid-stream.
   `pydantic-ai`'s iterator does expose tool-call begin/end nodes; we'd
   want `StreamEvent.tool_call_start / tool_call_args / tool_call_end /
   tool_result` kinds and a matching `AGUIEncoder` mapping. (Tracked as F13
   for iteration 4 / HITLGate where this becomes load-bearing.)

3. **No place in the framework for "domain repo + UoW" outside of the
   built-in thread/persistence subpackages.** Apps that grow a domain
   (notes, tickets, etc.) re-invent `Protocol + InMemoryImpl + TODO
   Postgres impl` for every domain. A documented "domain template"
   (Protocol shape, tenant-scoping conventions, idempotency rules) or even
   a `ballast.persistence.scaffolds.repository` mini-helper
   would shorten the iteration-N onboarding.

4. **Module-scope app state for the notes repo feels off.** `build_app()`
   takes a `notes_repo=` injection, but the module-level `app = build_app()`
   reuses a process singleton. A real app would want a request-scoped or
   workflow-scoped factory. The framework's `Engine` could grow a
   `Container`-style DI hook (`engine.provide(NoteRepository,
   factory=...)`) so `build_app()` stops being a manual wiring graph.

### Framework gaps to track for next round

- [x] **F12** — `make_runner(deps=...)` accepts a callable / awaitable
  deps-factory so per-request deps don't force apps to copy the adapter
  body. *Landed in framework Round 2 / Group E.*
- [x] **F13** — Canonical `tool_call_*` `StreamEvent` kinds + `AGUIEncoder`
  mapping, so frontends can render mid-stream tool activity (and so
  iteration 4's HITLGate has a natural surface to interpose on).
  *Landed in framework Round 2 / Group E — `make_runner` now drives
  `agent.iter` and forwards `TOOL_CALL_START` / `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` /
  `TOOL_CALL_END` per real function-tool call (synthetic `final_result`
  output-tool calls are suppressed).*
- [ ] **F14** — Domain-repo scaffold / docs (Protocol conventions,
  tenant scoping, idempotency rules). Cheap; would shave 30 LOC per
  domain in dogfood apps.
- [ ] **F15** — `Engine` DI container hook for app-defined resources
  (repos, clients) so module-scope singletons stop creeping into
  `main.py`.

### What we tested

- **Direct unit tests** of `InMemoryNoteRepository` via the registered
  tools — create persists, search is case-insensitive across title+body,
  update raises `KeyError` for wrong-tenant, delete is idempotent, list is
  tenant-scoped. All run without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- **Live OpenRouter smoke** asks the model to "Create a note titled
  'Grocery list' with body 'milk, eggs, bread'." and asserts the in-memory
  repo has a matching row after `RUN_FINISHED`. Skipped automatically when
  no key is configured.

## Iteration 2.1 update — framework Groups A + B landed

Group A (canonical AG-UI event kinds) and Group B (the `make_runner`
adapter + typed `MessagePart` + `AgentRunner` Protocol) are now in. The
notes-app backend reflects this:

- `notes_app/agent.py` no longer hand-rolls a runner — it just exposes
  `build_agent()`. The wire-level translation lives in the framework's
  `make_runner` adapter.
- `notes_app/main.py` calls `make_runner(build_agent(), text_field="reply")`
  inside a lazy wrapper (so the app still boots without
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
- `tests/test_smoke.py` asserts the canonical event kinds —
  `RUN_STARTED` / `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` / `RUN_FINISHED` — instead of the
  old `text_delta` / `done`. The `_fake_runner` signature now includes
  the framework-supplied `run_id` kwarg.

Net effect for consumers: a notes-app-style backend goes from ~80 LOC of
agent-runner glue to a one-liner. Friction points #1, #2, #3, and #5
from the iteration-2 list are gone; #4 (assistant reply persistence) and
#6/#7 (boot log, CORS) remain for Groups C and D.

## Iteration 3 framework round 2 — Group E (F12 + F13) landed

The two iteration-3 friction points (per-request `deps` factory + missing
tool-call SSE events) are now framework features:

- **F12** — `make_runner(agent, *, text_field, deps=...)` accepts either
  a static value (legacy) or a callable / coroutine factory invoked with
  `(thread_id, run_id, message, tenant_id)` per HTTP request.
- **F13** — `make_runner` switched from `agent.run_stream` to
  `agent.iter` so it can observe pydantic-ai's per-node events. Text
  deltas still flow as `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`; each real function-tool
  call now also emits `TOOL_CALL_START` → `TOOL_CALL_ARGS` (× N) →
  `TOOL_CALL_END`. The synthetic `final_result` tool that pydantic-ai
  uses for structured `output_type=BaseModel` output is suppressed (it's
  a transport detail — not a tool the frontend should render).

Backend impact: `build_notes_runner` shrank from ~40 LOC of hand-rolled
`run_stream` + diff loop to a 4-line `deps_factory` closure passed to
`make_runner(deps=...)`. The notes-app smoke + unit tests pass unchanged.

"""Streaming + cancellation endpoints for per-thread agent runs.

Resolves the per-thread agent from the app's ``agents`` ``Registry``
(``notes_app.agents.agents``) and delegates to the framework's
``stream_response`` / ``cancel_thread_workflows`` primitives. Framework
infra is reached via ``ballast.get_engine()`` — the process-wide singleton
wired by ``ballast.create_app`` at startup.
